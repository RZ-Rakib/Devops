# Task 2 – Tally Counter REST API

## Overview
This project implements a simple **Tally Counter REST API** using **Node.js 18**, **Express 4.18.2**, and **Winston 3.11.0**.  
The application provides three endpoints to manage a counter:  
- `/counter-read` → read the current counter value  
- `/counter-increase` → increase the counter by one  
- `/counter-reset` → reset the counter to zero  

All operations are logged with Winston at different log levels (`info`, `warn`, `error`).  
Logs are stored both in the console and in log files under the `logs/` directory.
